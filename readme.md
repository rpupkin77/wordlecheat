# Simple Wordle Cheat Program

## Overview
This is a simple cheat program for wordle, there are much more sophisticated ones, but were they written in 30 minutes while waiting for pants to come out of the dryer? I think not!

## How to use
Dear Scoundrels: Only use if you are stuck.

Usage is simple. Add the letters you know are in the word to the `my_letters` list, add the letters you know are going to be excluded to the `exclude_letters` list.

You get one green hint. If you know the position of a letter, assign the letter (as a string) to the `known_letter` variable, add the position as an int to the `position` variable.

Note taht `position` would start at one, so if you know the first letter, set `position` to 1, and so on and so forth.
